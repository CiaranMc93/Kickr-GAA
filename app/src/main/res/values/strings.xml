        This application was developed in order to provide an easy way for people to view fixtures and results
        for their favourite teams. I am a footballer from Laois who plays for O\'Dempseys football club. This
        club means a lot to me and I wanted to provide something back to the GAA community because of the way I
        have been treated over the years. The GAA commuity is special in how everyone interacts and enjoys the matches.
        This application just makes it easier for viewing when matches are coming and the results of previous matches.
        This application will be continuously developed for as long as possible and updates
        will be forthcoming.

        any issues are fixed ASAP.
